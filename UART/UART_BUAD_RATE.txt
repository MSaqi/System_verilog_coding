UART TX-RX BUAD RATE to clk frequency mapping

BUAD RATE is defined as the Bits per second (bps)

This is pre set for each UART module which means both RX and TX guys needs to send the Data on this speed 

BUAD RATES commonly used 
4800 , 9600 , 19200 .. etc 
lower values has lower frequency mapping as lower number bits are sent in 1 second  

for example we can have BUAD rate as 9600 bps we need to map the frequency on which UART Module needs to sample data let Dive in 
First we need to find how many seconds does it take ot send or recieve only 1 bit if this BUAD rate is set.
for that we can simply get the propotional method to find the Per pit time 
9600 bps : 1sec
1 bit    : xsec

1/9600 = x ;
x = 0.000104167 
104x10^-6 ; 
so we have this as time period required for 1 bit to change or toggle or remain stable ;

this directly states how much our clk period time should have ;
clk period = time required for 1 bit 
clk frequency  = clk_period / 2;
we have this number in ms if there is some differenc in Timescale we need to have some clk g or clk divider to achieve the clk or write your own by using FLOPS
